Nov.10 around: We can already use the environment GNOME installed on Micro SD.
Nov.25: we found that our initial SDcard system is just a test system, so I have to boot a new one. After insulting the Steven, I have boot the ubuntu system. And test tomorrow.
Nov 26: successfully boot the ubuntu 12.04 system(take some time to figure who to make ethernet and static ip correctly), with lxde desktop. Seems working speed of this system is slow. Then I will figure out if it can compile programming successfully.
